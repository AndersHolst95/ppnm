chapter 12, 2.5
	we looked at this last week

chapter 7
2.0
	it is marked in the header where the third bit is set to zero (this bit is thus set to 0 if no fragmentation has occurred)

3.0
	1500 bytes * (2^16 - 1) / (600Mbps) = 1.311 seconds

4.0
	destination		next_hub
	200.0.5.0/24	LAN
	200.0.6.0/24	LAN
	default 		B

Dette kunne er unÃ¸dvendigt, da defalut er B
	200.0.9			B
	200.0.10		B
	200.0.7			B
	200.0.8			B


	destination		next_hub
	200.0.5.0/24	A	
	200.0.6.0/24    LAN
	200.0.9.0/24    LAN
	200.0.10.0/24   C
	200.0.7.0/24    LAN
	200.0.8.0/24    D
	defult 			D

6.0
	129: 10000001 does not match on the first 23 bits of the protocol
	130: 10000010 does match (is the same)
	131: 10000011 does match, the last bit is irrelevent
	132: 10000100 does not mach

6.5
	255: 11111111
	248: 11111000
a)
	11111111.11111111.11111000.00000000
	All of the ones should match, but the zeros after does not needs to mathc, therefore in /k notation it is "/21"

b) /27
	255.255.255.224
	244: 11100000

8.0
a)
	B will not recive, ans B has changed its LAN adress, and the message is only sent to the LAN adress of B.
	A will not recieve an answer and make a broadcast afterwards
b) 
	B will recieve the message, as the message will be sent to all of the initas the the LAN. B has not changed its IP, but it has changed its LAN adress. It will therefore reply with its new adress, and A can then update the adress. During the broadcast, A will send both its own IP and LAN adress, and then all of the local units will update thir values for A.

9.0
	 When A boradcasts, it also sends its own IP and LAN adress. Then all of the units at the LAN will save the information of A, therefre as A has just boradcasted, B will most likely have the information of A.

	 It can go wrong if)
	 If A has changed its LAN adress after its broadcast. in IPv4 packet, only the source IP is given and therefore B would have to know the LAN adress of A itself. THrefore A would use the sored value but if A has changed its LAN after B has stored it, it will go wrong.

	
10.0
	now A will not recieve a message, because all of the units now has a wrong LAN adress of A saved in the ARP.
	Instead B will send its answer to C, and noone will be able to send to A.


11.0
	a) We will be able to recieve packages, as we do not cut the connection with the wireless, and we can recieve the packages we might miss. We now send on the new adress, and B will either send to that adress or stop sending, depending on security. (Bank might close connections)

	b) We cannot recieve the remaing packages, as the connection is closed. We send on a new Adress, and B will again either close or just send to the new adress.

2.0
a) 
	A table
	destination		cost		next hop
	B				3			B
	C				3+4			B
	D				2			D
	E				2+1			D

	F table
	destination		cost		next hop
	C				12			C
	E				1			E
	B				12+4		C
	D				1+1			E

b) it would take 4 iterations of parallel exchange



2.5
	destination 	cost		next hop
	A				2			R1
	B				3			R2 (or R1)
	C				4 + 1		R1
	D				3 + 1		R1


3.0

	destination		cost		next hop
	A				5			R1
	B				7 + 1		R1
	C				7			R2
	D				6 + 1		R1
	E				9			R1 (or R2)
	F				9			R1

5.0
a)
	destination 	cost		next hop
	B				1			B
	C				2			B
	D				1			D
	E				inf			D

b)
	destination		cost		next hop
	A				1			A
	C				1			C
	D				2			A
	E				2			C


7.0
a)
	B now has the fastes way to get to each router, making it valid?

b)
	We wait 2 cycles, so that we are sure the neighboring ways does not go through us selves, and use the same broken connection that created the problem


10.0
a)
	The cost from B to A is greater than 0, therefore if we want to go to D, and the shortest path is thorugh A, A must have a shorter route to D than B, since the route to A is nonzero

b)
	Since the remaining distance through a new loop always decreases, we can never return to the current node, as that would increase the remaing path.

11.0
	the fastes way from C to A is through B. If B1 breaks, then B will change its route, and data wil go from B to C, but C does not know this, and still sends Data to C so data can go C->B->C


13.0
	which route: It can take wichever, but will almost always take the fastest.
	which way does it flow: It can be seen on the LAN adress
	how can you change preferences in OS: This situation is on Linux systems adjusted by changing arp_ignore and arp_announce in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all.
