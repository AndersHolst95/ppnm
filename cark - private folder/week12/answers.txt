1.0: propergation delay 20 micro sec and bandwidth of 2 bytes/microsec

a) How long would it take to transmit 600 byte package
	20 + 600/2 = 320 micro seconds

b) How long would it take 600 over two links with store and forward switch
	40 + 3*300/2 = 490 microseconds

3.5: 
	a) A - S
	b) S - B
	c) starts in b, ends the propagation delay of S-B
	d) bandwidth of S-B 157 sec
	e) same as above 
	
	total time is somehthing sheila calculated

14.0:
	a) show that 2-D parity can detect any three errors
